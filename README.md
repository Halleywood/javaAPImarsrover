This is a project I built with help of Udemy instructor Trevor Page. I love making API calls and wanted to learn how to transfer data from an API to a website I designed using Java and Spring Tool Suite. I love using Object Oriented Programming like Java to tap into fully built out and functional classes like RestTemplate to pull data from any API and converting it to JSON. Once you have a JSON object you can create anything on the front end, which is why software and web development are truly amazing.
